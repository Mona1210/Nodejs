        <!--Disadv of transitions
        Transition starts only when some event like focus or hover occurs
        we can specify only initial and final state for transitions, not intermediate state

        Animations - same like transitions but we can specify intermediate states and can start without events

        Animation is done using keyframes. we specify from and to using these keywords or using % - 0% - start, 100%-end
        animation-name, animation-duration (time to complete 1 iteration), animation-timing (to control pace),
        animation-delay (delay before start of anim), animation-iteration-count (no fo times anim plays, default 1)

        <!--RWD techniques
            Fluid layouts - Use relative units like % and not px
            Flexible images - define width of image as % of container width
            media query - @media screen is used to define properties based on browser viewport width

            media types - handlheld, print, screen (any screen), tv
            media features - device-height, device-width, height, width (of viewport) - all are numbers
            orientation - landscape/portrait; resolution - number; device - number

            <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"> - this prevents the website to overflow
            when assessed in mobile
            viewport width > Browser width > page is wider than browser - issue

                <p>Angkor Wat is a temple at Angkor, Cambodia, built in the capital city for King Suryavarman II 
                    in the early 12th century as the state temple. The largest and best-preserved temple at the 
                    site, it is the only one to have remained a significant religious center—first Hindu, then 
                    Buddhist—since its foundation. The temple is the epitome of the high classical style of Khmer 
                    architecture. It has become a symbol of Cambodia, appearing on its national flag, and is the 
                    country's prime attraction for visitors. Angkor Wat combines two basic plans of Khmer temple 
                    architecture: the temple mountain and the later galleried temple. It is designed to represent 
                    Mount Meru, home of the gods in Hindu mythology.</p>

                <p>At the center of the temple stands a quincunx of towers. The temple is admired for the grandeur 
                    and harmony of its architecture and for the extensive bas-reliefs and the numerous devatas adorning 
                    its walls. Unusually, Angkor Wat faces the west; scholars are divided as to the significance of this.</p>
